### **📃 Description**

Zappy is a **Solo fully automated game**:
The goal of this project is to create a network game where several teams confront each other on
a tile map containing resources.

The winning team is the first one where at least 6 players reach the maximum elevation.
The following pages describe all the details and constraints.

### Resources available:
The environment is rather rich in resources (mineral as well as dietary).
The server spawns resources upon starting and every 20 time units.
```
✓ linemate
✓ deraumere
✓ sibur
✓ mendiane
✓ phiras
✓ thystame
```

### 📌 Activities

Trantor’s inhabitants take care of two things:
```
✓ feeding themselves
✓ looking for, and collecting, stones
```

### 📌 The Elevation Ritual

Everyone’s goal is to rise up in the Trantorian hierarchy.
To do so, they must gather resources and perform a ritual.
```
✓ At least a certain number of each stones
✓ At least a certain number of players with the same level
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the whole C standard library.
